# Admin Panel Features & Usage Guide

The Admin Panel allows you to manage inventory, update settings, and process customer orders.

## 1. Key Features
- **Dashboard:** Real-time stats and low-stock alerts.
- **Products:** Create and edit products, manage images, and set promotional badges (NEW, SALE, etc.).
- **Settings:** Update your contact info (Email/Phone) and set currency exchange rates.

## 2. Step-by-Step Example: Fulfilling an Order

Here is how an administrator manages a new incoming order:

1. **Notification:** When a user places an order, you will see a **purple badge** with a number next to "Orders" in your admin sidebar (e.g., "Orders [1]").
2. **Reviewing:** Click **"Orders"** to see the list. New orders are marked as **"Pending"**.
3. **Details:** Click **"View Details"** on the specific order. You will see:
   - The customer's Name and Phone.
   - The Shipping Address.
   - The specific products and total amount.
4. **Processing:** Once you start preparing the package, change the status to **"Processing"**.
5. **Shipping:** After sending the items, update the status to **"Shipped"**. The user will see this update in their profile in real-time.
6. **Completion:** When the customer receives the item, mark it as **"Delivered"**.

## 3. Handling Cancellations
- If a customer contacts you to cancel or if there is an issue, you can mark the order as **"Cancelled"**.
- **Important:** When you cancel an order, the system **automatically adds the items back to your stock count**, so you don't lose inventory availability.

## 4. Setting Store Contacts
To ensure users can reach you:
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Scroll to **Contact Settings**.
3. Enter your **Admin Email** and **Admin Phone**.
4. These details will appear in the guest "Contact" popup and on the user's "My Orders" page.
